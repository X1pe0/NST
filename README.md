## Non Shitty Teams

Non Shitty Teams or (NST) is a CefSharp Chromium application 
meant to take place of the default install of Microsoft Teams. 
The app itself has no telemetry phoning home to Microsoft’s servers 
(other than the standard telemetry when signing in/default chat usage) 
and uses a lightweight library with minimal RAM usage. This application 
comes with a WTFPL license which can be seen below.

## The Deets and Info's
NST by default saves Team’s attachments within the users documents folder. This will be changed within the near future to allow some style of customization. All cache and CefSharp content is saved within the users AppData folder within the directory NS_T for debugging. 

##### FYI's
###### Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.8 to run.
